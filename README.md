# Econometrics-Final-Project
Econometrics final project, completed with a group of 5 people. 

We want to investigate the question "How does high school size affect college GPA?" We decided to use the data set GPA2, found in the Wooldridge package. This data set comes from a midsize research university that supports men and women athletics at the Division I level. The original data set has 4,137 observations on 12 variables, including college GPA, combined SAT scores, high school size, and high school rank. There are also several dummy variables, such as athlete, gender, and race. Our main goal is to find out how the size of an individuals high school affects their college GPA; however, we will also investigate some other facets, such as "Does being an athlete affect GPA?" and "Does being male or female have an effect on GPA?" Understanding the effect that certain variables have on college GPA can give us a better understanding of how we can best prepare for college and could help guide changes in high school to create the most productive setting for learning.
